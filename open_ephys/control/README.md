# `open_ephys.control`

This module makes it possible to control the [Open Ephys GUI](https://open-ephys.org/gui) via Matlab, either running locally or over a network.

## OpenEphysHTTPServer

Starting in GUI v0.6.0 we recommend using the OpenEphysHTTPServer to control the GUI remotely. 

### Usage

Create an instance of the OpenEphysHTTPServer class:

```matlab
gui = OpenEphysHTTPServer('127.0.0.1', 37497)
```

Get the processor list (all available processors to use in a signal chain)

```matlab
gui.getProcessorList()
```

Get the processors in the current signal chain

```matlab
gui.getProcessors()
```

Clear the current signal chain

```matlab
gui.clearSignalChain()
```

Add a processor to the signal chain (source and destination are optional, if not included will add to end of signal chain)

```matlab
gui.addProcessor(processorName, source, destination)
```

Delete a processor from the signal chain

```matlab
gui.deleteProcessor(processorId)
```

Get the parameters for a processor

```matlab
gui.getParameters(processorId, streamIdx)
```

Set the parameters for a processor

```matlab
gui.setParameter(processorId, streamIdx, paramName, value)
```

Get recording information

```matlab
gui.getRecordingInfo(key)
```

Set parent recording directory
    
```matlab
gui.setParentDirectory(path)
```

Set prepend text

```matlab
gui.setPrependText(text)
```

Set base text

```matlab
gui.setBaseText(text)
```

Set append text

```matlab
gui.setAppendText(text)
```

Set start new directory flag (starts a new directory for the next recording)

```matlab
gui.setStartNewDirectory()
```

Set file path to load for a FileReader

```matlab
gui.setFileReaderPath(nodeId, path)
```

Set file index to load for a FileReader

```matlab
gui.setFileReaderIndex(nodeId, index)
```

Set record engine

```matlab
gui.setRecordEngine(nodeId, engine)
```

Set record path

```matlab
gui.setRecordPath(nodeId, directory)
```

Get GUI status (acquiring, recording or idle)

```matlab
gui.getStatus()
```

Start acquisition (duration is optional)

```matlab
gui.acquire(duration)
```

Stop recording (duration is optional)

```matlab
gui.record(duration)
```

Stop acquisition/recording (duration is optional)

```matlab
gui.idle(duration)
```

Send a text message to all processors in the signal chain

```matlab
gui.message(text)
```

Quit the GUI

```matlab
gui.quit()
```

## NetworkControl

### Usage

Your GUI's signal chain must include a [NetworkEvents](https://open-ephys.github.io/gui-docs/User-Manual/Plugins/Network-Events.html) plugin in order for this module to work.

To use the control module in Matlab:

- [Download ZeroMQ](https://zeromq.org/download/) for your specific platform
- Edit the paths to your zmq library file locations in control/matlab-zmq/config.m
- Run control/matlab-zmq/make.m to generate the required .mex files

Note: There are known issues when generating mex files for Matlab 2017+. It is possible to generate the mex files with an older version of Matlab and copy them to a newer version of Matlab. 

See this issue for more information:

## Usage

### Initialization

To control a GUI instance running on the same machine, simply enter:

```matlab
gui = NetworkControl()
```

To specify a custom IP address or port number, use:

```matlab
gui = NetworkControl('10.127.50.1', 2000)
```

### Starting and stopping acquisition

To start acquisition, enter:

```matlab
gui.startAcquisition()
```

To stop acquisition, enter:

```matlab
gui.stopAcquisition()
```
    
To query acquisition status, use:

```matlab
gui.isAcquiring()
```

### Starting and stopping recording

To start recording, enter:

```matlab
gui.startRecording()
```

To stop recording while keeping acquisition active, enter:

```matlab
gui.stopRecording()
```
    
To query recording status, use:

```matlab
gui.isRecording()
```

### Sending TTL events

To send a TTL "ON" event, enter:

```matlab
gui.sendTTL(5, 1) %channel = 5, state = 1
```

To send a TTL "OFF" event, enter:

```matlab
gui.sendTTL(5, 0) %channel = 5, state = 0
```
